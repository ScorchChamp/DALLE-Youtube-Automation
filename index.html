        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I made many automated youtube channels in the past using twitch clips. These channels grossed around 27.000.000 views total. 
            I want to try and create a completely new youtube channel that creates videos using ChatGPT to generate the script and DALL-E to generate background images.
            The script will be gradually upgraded and spoken by TTS (First a free TTS, then I will use the advertisement budget from this website and the channel to use azure TTS</p>
